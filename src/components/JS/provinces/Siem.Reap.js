        <p>Siem Reap, a resort town in northwestern Cambodia, is the gateway to the ruins of Angkor,
            the seat of the Khmer kingdom from the 9th–15th centuries. Angkor’s vast complex of intricate stone buildings includes preserved Angkor Wat,
            the main temple, which is pictured on Cambodia’s flag. Giant, mysterious faces are carved into the Bayon Temple at Angkor Thom</p>
